the implementation is based on article:
https://towardsdatascience.com/faster-r-cnn-object-detection-implemented-by-keras-for-custom-data-from-googles-open-images-125f62b9141a

read me. 

data_preprocessing is to use the input file from dataset and reorganized in the way faster R-CNN required. the output file is annotation.txt and test_annotation.txt.
frcnn_train_vgg is the file use to perform training. 
frcnn_test_vgg is the file use for testing.
